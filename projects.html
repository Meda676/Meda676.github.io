                  Visual Odometry tecniques for autonomous flight of drones (Masters Thesis)

                <span class="projects-description">
                I developed a flight control system capable of keeping track of the entire trajectory travelled by a drone, with
		a reduced dependency on the availability of GPS signal. This project is based on a monocular visual odometry
		technique and it is aimed to overcome some limitations related to the use of GPS signals. The flight control
		algorithm was initially integrated within an offline procedure, in which the information collected during the
		flight are batch-processed at a later time, and then this procedure was transformed into a real-time version of it
		through the use of remote processing. In addition, a custom application was developed to make it possible the
		communication between the remote controller of the UAV and the board which performs the remote processing.
		The final purpose of this project is to perform the entire computation on board to the drone itself using an external
		board as a payload, which communicates directly with the drone, in order to make it completely autonomous.

                I developed a C++ software whit the aim of analyzing the telemetry data recorded by a racing motorbike. This
		software reads the data recorded by the IMU platform, and by all the possible sensors on the motorbike, and
		analyze them by applying some techniques designed to find interesting points during the ride. I used this software
		working as a telemetry operator for the Vieri Racing Team during a season of the CIV (Campionato Italiano
		Velocità) with pretty good results.

                The objective of this project was to create a neural network able to solve, moves by moves, a Rubik’s Cube. To
		do this I created different configurations of a multilayer perceptron neural network using Python as a language
		with Tensorflow and Keras as libraries. The final result was a neural network able to solve the Rubik’s Cube with
		good performance, if the cube is not too far from the solution, without using nothing about mathematical or
		heuristic rule, just approaching it like a human.

                The objective of this project was to create a recommendation systems based on different kind of Big Data analyzing

		systems based on the ALS (Alternating Least Square) techniques, the NNR (Nearest Neighbor Recommender)
		approach and a content-based recommender. At the end we developed also an hybrid version that combines all
		the others versions.
